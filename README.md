# shepherd-launcher

A child-friendly, parent-guided launcher for Wayland, allowing supervised
access to applications and content that you define.

Its primary goal is to return control of child-focused computing to parents,
not software or hardware vendors, by providing:

* the ease-of-use of game consoles
* access to any application that can be run, emulated, or virtualized in desktop Linux
* with access controls similar to iOS Screen Time

While this repository provides some recipes for existing software packages
(including non-free software), shepherd-launcher is *non-prescriptive*: as the
end user, you are free to use (or not use) them or write your own.

## Screenshots

TODO:

* home screen at different times showing different applications
* modern proprietary application showcase (Minecraft, individual Steam games)
* emulated application showcase (ScummVM games, 90s edutainment on Win9x, Waydroid)
* externally managed ChromeOS Flex for access to school resources
* media showcase (local storage and individual titles from streaming services)
* time limit popup
* "token" system

## Installation

tl;dr:

1. any Linux with Wayland (optional: TPM-based FDE plus BIOS password to prevent tampering)
2. Sway + config
3. binaries (TODO: deployable package that depends on Sway and installs the config)
4. test session on login
5. configure auto-login to this session
