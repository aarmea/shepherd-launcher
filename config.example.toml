# Secret of Monkey Island via ScummVM
# Like above, but with the following caveats:
# * I have only tested this with the original CD-ROM version of the game.
# * The GOG version at https://www.gog.com/en/game/the_secret_of_monkey_island_special_edition uses a different engine.
# * It does *not* contain ScummVM-compatible data files, so this entry will not work with that version.
# * It may be possible to extract compatible files from the GOG installer or run it via WINE, but that is outside the scope of this example.
# * See https://www.gratissaugen.de/ultimatetalkies/ for how to do this.
