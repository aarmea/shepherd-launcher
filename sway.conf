# Shepherd Launcher - Kiosk Mode Sway Configuration
# This config makes Sway act as a kiosk environment with a custom launcher

### Variables
set $launcher ./target/debug/shepherd-launcher
set $hud ./target/debug/shepherd-hud

### Output configuration
# Set up displays (adjust as needed for your hardware)
output * bg #000000 solid_color

# Hide ALL window borders and focus indicators by making them transparent/black
# Note: The 5th value is the "child_border" which is the actual visible border
client.focused          #000000 #000000 #ffffff #000000 #000000
client.focused_inactive #000000 #000000 #888888 #000000 #000000
client.unfocused        #000000 #000000 #888888 #000000 #000000
client.urgent           #000000 #000000 #ffffff #000000 #000000
client.placeholder      #000000 #000000 #888888 #000000 #000000
client.background       #000000

# Completely hide focus indicator by hiding the mark
hide_edge_borders --i3 both

### Idle configuration
# Prevent screen from turning off (adjust timeout as needed)
exec swayidle -w \
    timeout 600 'swaymsg "output * dpms off"' \
    resume 'swaymsg "output * dpms on"'

### Input configuration
# Disable touchpad/mouse acceleration if needed
input type:pointer {
    accel_profile flat
}

### Key bindings - HEAVILY RESTRICTED for kiosk mode

# Disable ALL default Sway keybindings by not setting a modifier
# This prevents users from opening terminals, switching workspaces, etc.

# Disable TTY switching (Ctrl+Alt+F1-F12)
# This is handled by disabling VT switching at the kernel/systemd level
# Add this to kernel parameters: vt.handoff=0
# Or in /etc/systemd/logind.conf: NAutoVTs=0 and ReserveVT=0

# Emergency exit for admin (Super+Shift+Escape) - REMOVE IN PRODUCTION
bindsym Mod4+Shift+Escape exit

### Window rules for kiosk behavior

# Shepherd HUD should always be visible on top (likely uses layer-shell protocol)
# Layer shell surfaces are automatically handled by sway and don't need window rules

# Make launcher windows fullscreen
for_window [app_id="shepherd-launcher"] fullscreen enable

# Make other windows fullscreen by default and remove decorations
for_window [class=".*"] fullscreen enable, border none, title_format ""
for_window [app_id=".*"] fullscreen enable, border none, title_format ""

# Minecraft Launcher (Electron app) and Minecraft Java Edition (game)
# Launcher: class="Minecraft Launcher" instance="minecraft-launcher"
# Game: class="Minecraft 1.21.11" instance="Minecraft 1.21.11" (version varies)
# We add "focus" to ensure the window gets focus when it appears
for_window [class="^Minecraft [0-9]"] fullscreen enable, border none, focus
for_window [instance="^Minecraft [0-9]"] fullscreen enable, border none, focus
for_window [class="^Minecraft Launcher$"] fullscreen enable, border none
for_window [instance="^minecraft-launcher$"] fullscreen enable, border none

# Disable window decorations (no title bars) - for all windows
default_border none
default_floating_border none

# Force pixel border of 0 explicitly
default_border pixel 0
default_floating_border pixel 0

# Force no border on XWayland windows
for_window [shell="xwayland"] border none, border pixel 0

# Tell clients not to draw their own decorations (for apps that respect this)
# Note: Many Electron apps ignore this
titlebar_border_thickness 0
titlebar_padding 0 0

# Disable gaps
gaps inner 0
gaps outer 0

# Force focus mode - only one visible window at a time
workspace_layout tabbed
focus_follows_mouse no

# Prevent window closing via keybindings (no Alt+F4)
# Windows can only be closed by the application itself

# Hide mouse cursor after inactivity
seat * hide_cursor 5000

### Workspace configuration

# Use only one workspace for true kiosk mode
workspace 1 output *

### Application startup

# Start the daemon FIRST - it needs to create the socket before HUD/launcher connect
# Running inside sway ensures all spawned processes use the nested compositor
exec ./target/debug/shepherdd -c ./config.example.toml

# Give the daemon a moment to initialize, then start UI components
# Start the shepherd-hud (time remaining overlay)
exec sleep 1 && $hud

# Start the shepherd-launcher on startup (the main "home" screen)
# Small delay to ensure daemon is ready
exec_always sleep 1 && $launcher

### Disable workspace switching
# No keybindings defined = no switching possible

### Status bar - DISABLED for kiosk mode
# bar {
#     position top
# }

### Additional security measures

# Disable Xwayland if not needed (prevents X11 escape hatches)
# xwayland disable

# Prevent floating windows (everything fullscreen)
for_window [floating] fullscreen enable

# Lock down IPC for security (prevents external control)
# ipc {
#     socket disable
# }

### Focused window indicator
# Since there's no title bar, no visual indication needed
focus_on_window_activation focus

### Mouse bindings - DISABLED
# No mouse bindings defined to prevent window manipulation

### Notes for production deployment:
# 1. Remove the emergency exit keybinding (Super+Shift+Escape)
# 2. Add kernel parameter: vt.handoff=0
# 3. Configure auto-login to this Sway session
# 4. Set up systemd to restart Sway if it crashes
# 5. Consider using a systemd user service for the launcher
# 6. Lock down sudo/root access
# 7. Disable virtual console switching in /etc/systemd/logind.conf:
#    NAutoVTs=0
#    ReserveVT=0
# 8. Consider running as a dedicated user account with limited permissions
